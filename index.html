<section class="mission">
    Hi, I’m Rohith — a passionate and aspiring bilingual web developer currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Kumaraguru College of Technology.
I specialize in building interactive and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Alongside coding, I’m also learning Japanese and have completed the JLPT N5 level, aiming to work internationally in the future.
As a fresher, I bring a strong drive to learn, create, and grow — turning ideas into digital experiences.

Joining an MNC will help me learn from the best and grow both professionally and personally.

       <p>As part of my web development practice, I created a Product Landing Page to showcase a fictional product using modern HTML and CSS techniques.
The page includes a clear call-to-action, product features, embedded media, and responsive design.
It helped me understand layout hierarchy, visual appeal, and how to guide users through content.
This project strengthened my skills in building professional-looking marketing pages.</p>
